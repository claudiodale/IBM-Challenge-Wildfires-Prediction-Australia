# IBM-Challenge-Wildfires-Prediction-Australia
predict wildifres extension in Australia (IBM challenge)

INSTRUCTIONS:

“historical_wildfires_dates_predictions_datasetCreation.ipynb” notebook:

-with this notebook we create the dataset for each region for the three days for which predictions are required. These datasets are then imported into the main jupyter notebook “IBM Project” to add remaining feature, perform preprocessing and compute the predictions

“IBM Project.ipynb” notebook:

-this notebook contains exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, models creation and evaluation and final predictions.

Before running the IBM Project notebook run the “historical_wildfires_dates_predictions_datasetCreation.ipynb” notebook. In this way datasets later imported in the IBM Project notebook all be created.
